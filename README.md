    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Upon the initial installation, you will find the Dynamic Images block added the the multimedia block section of your website: </p>

    <h1>How To Use This Block</h1>
    <p> The edit block form has three tabs at the top.  The first tab is for the blocks content.  Since the block is used for creaing repeatable items, you will need to start out by clicking the 'Add Item' button.  To add multiple items simply click the 'Add Item' button for each image you'd like to add. </p>
    <p>
        To select an image, click the image icon next to the 'Collapse Details' button.  Select your image from the file manager and it will appear in the form.<br>
        Optionall, you may add a title that will be displayed along with the image when the block is displayed on your website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The custom class area lets you add a custom class to this specific element, incase you want to add custom styles from your own CSS.  Inside the layouts tab you can select one of the different layout options built in, or you may simply turn off syling if you plan to style it yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The options tab allows you to enable or disable certain features.  For example, you can disable showing the title, or even disable images altogether although in most cases you will want to keep this enabled.<br>
        The custom class field in the options tab allows you to add a custom class to the entire container rather than each individual element.  You can still use both of course, but applying a global class to the entire element is quicker than adding it to each element if you are creating your own styles for the block.
